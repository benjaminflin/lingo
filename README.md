TODO:

-   Data declerations
-   implement typeclasses
-   Finish typing rules

Edwards OH:

-   SYNTAX!!!
-   Type-checking concerns (typeclasses, multiplicities, etc. (No inference???))
-   Pipeline organization (Should we do our plan of parsing and then buildling
    multiple different lambdas that get set to different places)
-   Modified do notation ??? (he already said no, but we can still ask)
-   Implementation details (typeclasses, lambda calculus, algebraic data types (tagged unions??))
-   Mention to him more specifically our memory design and see what he say (garbage collection)
